        An engaging and emotionally aware resource for night owls, insomniacs,
        and anyone else who finds themselves awake at all hours, The Nocturnal
        Journal will help you explore what keeps you up at night, and why.
        Prompts and illustrations tease out the pressing thoughts, deep
        questions, everyday anxieties, and half-formed creative ideas that need
        unpacking and exploring, bringing more peace of mind and a richer
        understanding of ourselves. The perfect gift for journal lovers and
        anyone seeking emotional wellness, self care, and a clearer mind.
