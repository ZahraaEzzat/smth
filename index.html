      <br />This project is taken from <br />"The NOCTURNAL JOURNAL" <br />a
      late-night exploration of what's really on your mind.<br>This won't help you to sleep any better, or even at all. <br>But it will help you to make better use of those hours when you can't sleep.<br>In the modern world it's hard to find, make, or allow enough time to really connect with yourself.<br>This means that your worries get suppressed, your feelings stay unexplored, and your most<br>creative ideas remain itches that you don't have the time to scratch. <br>All of this floods your brain the moment you try to switch off for the night.<br>This website will hopefully help you to live a little better.
